        <hr/>
        <p>The greenhouse effect is a phenomenon where the Earth's atmosphere heats up. This can have very large consuquences. Just like how the fluid in a thermometer expands when it is heated up, when the whole ocean is heated up, even by a tiny amount, it expands, causing massive floods. Because warm water is fuel for hurricanes, hurricanes that feed off of warm ocean water can get really violent.</p>
