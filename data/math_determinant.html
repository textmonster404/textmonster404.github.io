        <hr/>
        <p>In <a href="linear_algebra.html" style="color:red;">linear algebra</a>, A determinant can be computed from the elements of a <a href="square_matrix.html">square matrix</a>. The determinant of a matrix <var>A</var> is denoted by <var>det(A)</var> The determinant can be computed for a matrix using simple formulas. However, there is a geometric explanation for it.<br/><br/>When visualizing a 2x2 matrix on a plane as a transformation, imagine an object on the plane. The determinant of that transformation is the amount that the area of that object gets scaled after the transformation. If a transformation flips the plane, then we represent that as a negative number.<br/><br/>In 3 dimensions, it is almost the same, except we are dealing with volume instead of area.</p>
