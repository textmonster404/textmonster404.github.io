            What is measure theory?
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have heard that the number of rationals is countably infinite while the number of reals is uncountably infinite, you may have had the thought that "almost all" real numbers are irrational; that if you throw a dart at the real numbers, the odds that you hit a rational are infinitesimal; that if the real number line were an iron bar, all of the mass would be in the irrational numbers. All this despite the fact that rationals are "dense".
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measure theory is the tool mathematicians use to formalize and study the idea of mass, especially in a continuum. In particular, the Lebesgue Measure is used to determine the mass of a subset of real numbers, and the is defined as follows: the (greatest possible) lower bound for the sum of lengths of open intervals covering the set. So the puzzle from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw">video</a> shows that the Lebesgue measure of the rational numbers is 0, since the relevant sum can be as small as we want! Isn't that a clever definition? And from the proof, you can see that this has everything to do with the fact that the rational numbers are countably infinite. Note, however, that plenty of uncountably infinite sets can also have Lebesgue measure 0, such as those with a fractal dimension between 0 and 1.
