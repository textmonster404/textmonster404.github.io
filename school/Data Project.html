        <div class="bold big">Hypothesis Justification:</div>
        <p>I chose this question because is very simple and is unbiased. &nbsp;It will probably produce simple but meaningful data. &nbsp;I also think that my hypothesis is pretty good. &nbsp;I think that 8th graders have gone more times than 7th graders because they have had more opportunities to go to Westminster Woods than 7th graders. &nbsp;

            <span class="bold">Q: </span>How close were your projections to your actual data for your whole group?<br />
            <span class="bold">A: </span>The first difference is in the size of the sample set. I had predicted that my sample set would consist of 31 people. The actual sample set was 27. To account for this difference I will provide percentages. The hypothesised percentage of people that went was 42%. The real precentage was 63%. 21% more Project X students attended Westminster Woods than I predicted.<br />
            <span class="bold">Q: </span>For your subset?<br />
            <span class="bold">A: </span>I predicted 7 7th Grade campers and 6 8th Grade campers. The realtiy is, there was 8 7th Grade campers and 9 8th Grade campers. I prected less campers in each subset than there actually was by 1 7th Grade camper and 3 8th Grade campers. Overall, I was fairly close.<br />
            <span class="bold">Q: </span>Why do you think your projections were off? What did you not account for?<br />
            <span class="bold">A: </span>I think I was off because I didn’t think that very many people would go to Westminster Woods. I also figured that 8th Graders had already gone and wouldn't want to go back. I think that I may have introduced my own bias into my hypothesis because I didn't have the greatest time there myself and thought that others would have the same feelings.<br />

            <span class="bold">A: </span>I could've made sure that I polled all 31 Project X students. I would start sooner next time.<br />
            <span class="bold">Q: </span>Would you keep the same subgroup? Why or why not?<br />
            <span class="bold">A: </span>I would keep the same subgroup because it is an easy piece of information to track. There isn't much to ask other than, "What is your grade?"<br />
            <span class="bold">Q: </span>Did the question you asked, get the data you were looking for?<br />
            <span class="bold">A: </span>The question I asked got the data I was looking for. I asked what I wanted to find and I got what I wanted to find.<br />
            <span class="bold">Q: </span>Would you change your question or your answer choices? If not, why not?<br />
            <span class="bold">A: </span>I wouldn’t change my question because of what I learned. I learned that more people went than I thought and more people only went once. I learned more from this mis-matching data than the data that I got correct.<br />
