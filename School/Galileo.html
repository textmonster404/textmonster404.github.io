His descendents had changed their family name from Bonaiuti (or Buonaiuti) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century. Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church, the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, where about 200 years later his more famous descendant Galileo Galilei was also buried.</div></span></div></td>

                    <div style="border-left:1px solid black;text-indent:2em;width:16em;text-align:justify;" title="Tide Theory"><hr style="width:16em;" align="left"><span style="text-indent:2em;"><div style="padding:0px 1em 0px 1em;">For Galileo, the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.</div></span></div></td><td style="padding-top:10px;"><br><br><div style="text-indent:2em;border-left:1px solid black;text-indent:2em;width:16em;text-align:justify;padding:0px 1em 0px 1em;" title="Tide Theory">If this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at Venice instead of one, about twelve hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors. Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments, Albert Einstein expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his "fascinating arguments" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth. Galileo dismissed the idea, held by his contemporary Johannes Kepler, that the moon caused the tides</div></td>

        <h3>Action of Courage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced science even with opposition from the church in the 1610s.
        </ul>
        <b>Positive Changes:</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>New understandings of the solar system. <i>(Heliocentric solar system)</i>
            <li style="list-style-type:circle;margin-left:2em;">The Milky Way is made up of several stars.
            <li style="list-style-type:circle;margin-left:2em;">The moon itself has its own hills.

            <li style="list-style-type:circle;margin-left:2em;">The planet Venus has phases just like the moon.
            <li>A new concept of gravity. <i>(everything falls at the same rate, regardless of mass)</i>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other Info:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Galileo had not invented the telescope, however, he <i>was</i> the first person to record and publish his findings and observations.
            <li>Inspired Isaac Newton to create his theories of gravitation.
            <li>Persecuted and under house arrest by the church for his work until 10 years later on his death.
