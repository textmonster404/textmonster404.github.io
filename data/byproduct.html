        <p>A byproduct is a chemical that is left over after some process. This chemical is usually disposed of. For example, when a plant takes in <a href="co2.html">carbon dioxide</a> for <a href="photosynthesis.html">photosynthesis</a>, it creates oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is released through the plant's leaves.</p>
