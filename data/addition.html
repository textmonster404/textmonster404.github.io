        <h1>Addition</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Addition is one of the 4 basic <a href="operation_math.html" style="color:red;">operations</a> of <a href="arithmetic.html" style="color:red;">arithmetic</a>; a field of <a href="math.html">mathematics</a>. The 4 operations are: Addition, <a href="subtraction.html" style="color:red;">Subtraction</a>, <a href="multiplication.html" style="color:red;">Multiplication</a>, and <a href="division.html" style="color:red;">Division</a>. Additionis commonly denoted by the plus symbol (+). Adding two numbers together can be though of breaking each number into that many 1's, then counting the total number of 1's. Saying, "2+3=5" is the same as saying, "2 of something and another 3 of something is five of that something."</p>
        <p>A common example in textbooks is using apples as units; "2 apples plus another 2 apples is 4 apples total."</p>
        <p>Addidtion can do more than just count groups of items, it is useful with things like <a href="complex_numbers.html" style="color:red;">complex numbers</a>, variables, and even <a href="matrix.html" style="color:red;">matrices</a>.</p>
        <p>One of the properties of addition is that it is communative. This means that <var>a+b=b+a</var>. Addition is also associative. This means that if we are adding more than one object together, it doesn't matter what order we add in. This even holds true for <a href="quaternions.html" style="color:red;">quaternions</a>, which are an extension to <a href="complex_numbers.html" style="color:red;">complex numbers</a>. When multiplying two quaternions together, the order acutally matters. But the order still doesn't matter for addition.</p>
