        <h1>Global Warming</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Global warming is a result of the <a href="greenhouse_effect.html">greenhouse effect</a>. When <a href="greenhouse_gas.html">greenhouse gasses</a> like <a href="co2.html">CO<sub>2</sub></a> and <a href="methane.html" style="color:red;">methane</a> are in the atmosphere, they let heat from the sun through, but not back out into space. This is much like a greenhouse, which traps heat inside it. This can heat up the oceans, which causes very drastic weather systems like <a href="hurricane.html" style="color:red;">hurricanes</a>. Just like how the fluid in a thermometer expands when it is heated up, the whole ocean expands when it is heated up. This can cause major floods and trillions of dollars of damage to cities and towns along coastlines.</p>
