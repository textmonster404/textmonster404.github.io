                        <ul>
                            <p>Two weeks ago your wagon train left for Fort Independence and traveled west toward Prairie Wells. Normally wagon trains stop at the small community to water the stock and fill water barrels. Scince there has been little rain this spring, most streams have been dry and water has been scarse. You and the rest of the members of your train have been looking forward to the fresh well water from Prairie Wells.</p>
                            <p>Even though you are all tired when you finally reach Prairie Wells, you go directly to the wells to fill your water barrels and water your stock. You are shocked to find four armed men guarding the wells. These residents of Prairie Wells inform you and the others that the water level is low. With water so scarse the once-free water is now going to cost you $10 a barrel.</p>
                            <p>Several people on the train say they cannot afford $10 for even one barrel, but most people need four barrels (two for themselves and two for their stock). Tired and discouraged, you return to your encampment just outside Prairie Wells to decide what to do.</p> 
                        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li/>Study the <b>Possible Actions</b> your wagon train can take to solve the problem.
            <li/>After each action analyze what may happen if you take that action. Tell whether or not you favor the action. Explain why.
            <li/>If you can think of a better action to take, write it in the <b>Another Action</b> box. Then analyze it as you did the other four.
            <li/>Write the <b>Best Action</b> of all in the box at the bottom of the page. This action might be one of the four given to you, the one you though up, or a combination of several different actions.
            <li/>After everyone is finished, meet with the other members of your wagon train. Decide together what action your train will take.
        </ol>
        <h3>Possible Actions</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>You need water desperately. You will not likely find water between here and Prairie Crossing. You should pay the $10 a barrel. Those who have the money should share the water with those who cannot afford the $10.
        </ol>
        <div>Pros:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>Everyone gets some
            <li/>Not very dangerous
        </ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
        <div>Cons:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>Less for each person
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <ol style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li value="2"/>Scince you need the water and can afford to pay the $10 per barrel, you want to pay. Those who cannot afford it will have to try to find their own water along the trail.
        </ol>
        <div>Pros:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>Those who pay get more water
        </ul>
        <div>Cons:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>There may not be enough for everyone
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <ol style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li value="3"/>You should not pay the ridiculously high price for the water. You should plan to move on first thing in the morning and hope to find enough water along the trail to get you safely to Pacific Crossing
        </ol>
        <div>Pros:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>Keep the money
        </ul>
        <div>Cons:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>May not get any water
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <ol style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li value="4"/>You need water but should not have to pay $10 a barrel. you and the others whould wait until dark, attack the guards and take the water.
        </ol>
        <div>Pros:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>Free water
        </ul>
        <div>Cons:</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
            <li/>You may get injured or killed
        </ul>
