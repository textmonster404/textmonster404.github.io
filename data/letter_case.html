        <h1>Letter Case</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Letter case is the distinction of letters that are in uppercase (majuscule) or lowercase (minuscule) in the written form of a language. In languages that use upper and lower cases for letters, every letter has one upper case representation and one lower case representation. Generally, uppercase letters are larger than lowercase. Each form of a letter is pronounced the same and is organised the same when in alphabetical order. For example, the <a href="latin.html" style="color:red;">latin</a> letter "a" is pronounced and treated the same regardless of whether it is uppercase (<i>A</i>) or lowercase (<i>a</i>).<br/><br/> The word "case" in "letter case" comes from older times, when letters were small blocks that were arranged, dipped in ink, then pressed onto a paper to create a document. Each "case" of a letter was stored in one of two physical cases; an "upper" case, and a "lower" case.</p>

        <p>In <a href="math.html">mathematics</a>, a capital letter "a" represents a different object than a small letter "a", unless stated otherwise.</p>
