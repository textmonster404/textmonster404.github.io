        <h1>Pure Mathematics</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Pure mathematics is a section of <a href="math.html">mathematics</a> that deals with purely abstract ideas and concepts. However, there is a lot of overlap between pure mathematics and <a href="applied_math.html">applied mathematics</a>. For example, when Gerolamo Cardano invented <a href="complex_numbers.html">complex numbers</a> while trying to find solutions to <a href="cubic_equations.html">cubic equations</a>, that same math came in handy when studying things like <a href="physics.html">physics</a> and <a href="fluid_dynamics.html">fluid dynamics</a>.<br/><br/>Very often, a concept in pure mathematics seems so abstract that it shouldn't have very many real applications; however, it often seems that the more abstract the idea, the more pactical uses it has.</p>
