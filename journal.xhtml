        <p indent="true" align="j">Today I attempted to learn more of the classroom dynamics.  I have been having a small amount of trouble figuring out everyone's names, but I figure that in enough time I will have everyone's names figured out.  Names have always been an issue for me, but I can learn them with time.</p>
        <p indent="true" align="j">Every morning I have to ride my bike to the school.  I have to leave at about 7:45 AM, as the school starts at 8:00 AM.  When I get to the office, I sign in and get a vistor badge.  I head to room 15, Leslie Foreé's room.  All of the kids call her Ms. Foreé, so I do too to avoid confusion.  I act as a T.A. (teacher's assistant).  I basically do anything that Ms. Foreé asks me to do.</p>
