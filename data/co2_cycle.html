        <hr/>
        <p>The CO<sub>2</sub> cycle is a natural cycle where carbon is moved around in an <a href="ecosystem.html">ecosystem</a>. Plants take in CO<sub>2</sub> through their leaves. This CO<sub>2</sub> is used in a process known as <a href="photosynthesis.html">photosynthesis</a>, where water, CO<sub>2</sub>, and sunlight are used to create sugar. This also creates oxygen as a <a href="byproduct.html">byproduct</a>. Animals like us breathe in the oxygen, then breathe out CO<sub>2</sub>. The plants use this CO<sub>2</sub> again and the cycle repeats.</p>
        <p>Plants and animals use these <a href="gas.html">gasses</a> to survive. The process of taking in and letting out gasses like oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> is known as <a href="respiration.html">respiration</a>.</p>
