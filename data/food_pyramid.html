        <hr/>
        <p>A food pyramid is a way to display the flow of energy in an ecosystem. The energy usually starts with the <a href="solar_energy.html">sun</a>. This energy is an abiotic factor. After that, there are usually plants, then some consumer, then some more consumers, etc. It is a pyramid because it represents how there is a lot less energy to go around at the top than there is at the bottom.</p>
