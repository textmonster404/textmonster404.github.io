        <h1>CO<sub>2</sub></h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>CO<sub>2</sub> is a very important <a href="gas.html" style="color:red;">gas</a>. It is made out of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.  It is a <a href="greenhouse_gas.html">greenhouse gas</a>, meaning that it contributes to the <a href="greenhouse_effect.html">greenhouse effect</a>. Plants use CO<sub>2</sub> in <a href="photosynthesis.html" style="color:red;">photosynthesis</a>. When they do this, it creates many <a href="byproduct.html">byproducts</a>, such as oxygen. This oxygen is then used by animals to breath. They in turn, breathe out CO<sub>2</sub>, and the cycle repeats. This is known as the <a href="co2_cycle.html">Carbon Cycle</a>.</p>

        <h3>Effects of Carbon Dioxide</h3>
        <p>When things like <a href="fossil_fuel.html" style="color:red;">fossil fuels</a> are burned for <a href="electricity.html" style="color:red;">electricity</a>, carbon dioxide is created as a byproduct. This can get into the <a href="atmosphere.html" style="color:red;">atmosphere</a>. When carbon dioxide gets into the atmosphere, it can trap heat. This is because it is a greenhouse gas. This causes <a href="global_warming.html" style="color:red;">global warming</a>. Data from ice cores tells us that our atmosphere hasn't had this much carbon dioxide in at least 420000 years!</p>
