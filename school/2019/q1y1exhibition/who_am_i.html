        <h3>Changes over time</h3>
		<div><b>09-19-2019</b></div>
        <p>Even though we may not think about it too often, the connection between time and space affects our everyday lives.  You can't meet someone at a place without a specified time.  You can't meet someone at a time without a specified place.  Our past can affect our present, but our present affects our future.  The goals that you set today can affect your future self.  Time is required to do anything, and our lives are shaped by time.<p/>
        <p>Time gives experience, wisdom, and intelligence.  There is only one present at a time, then it becomes the past.  People often think about how in time travel movies, changing one thing in the past can drastically affect the present.  But people don't really realise that changing one thing in the present can drastically change the future.</p>
        <p>Who we were is not who we are now, and who we are now is not who we will be.  But our past self can affect your future self, so do yourself a favor and act with reason, you'll thank yourself later.</p>
        <p>I used to be a different person than I am.  I was less mature, I knew a lot less, and I made decisions I regret now.  I don't mature behaviorally at the same pace as others.  Things that other people did automatically still took a lot of thought.  I still struggle with forming good habits, but I am getting better at it.</p>
        <p>Now, the dynamic is different than it was.  I have more responsibilities, but I don't always have the maturity to complete them.  I have autism and A.D.H.D., so I either can't focus on anything, or hyperfocus.  I am socially awkward but extremely social, so I don't always say what I should.  Things that a normal person would hold in their head would just fly out of my mouth, out of impulse.</p>
        <p>Saying things out of impulse can insult people.  Often times, the things I say are my thoughts about a person.  I don't stop to think, "how would this make them feel?"  Keep in mind, this is said out of impulse, and not out of rudeness.  I don't want to insult someone, but it happens without my control.  Unless I am really paying attention, it can be hard to prevent insulting someone.  Conversation is a delicate artform, and it can be entirely messed up by one misstroke.</p>
        <p>I want to not be like this.  These mental conditions that I have can be quite the nuscience.  They make me react in ways I don't want to.  I want to be a great mathematician or a math teacher, but my idiosyncrasies may get in the way.  I aspire to be successful.  I want to be something great.  But my own brain might get in the way of that.</p>
        <p>I have always been exceptional at math.  Even in 4th grade I had work that was above everyone else.  But my special ed. schools were making it difficult.  I had to self-educate myself.  This caused me to have a lot of holes in my knowledge.  My knowledge is extensive, but specific.  I know a lot, but have many gaps.</p>
        <p>I hope that I change for the better and go off to Berkeley U.C.  I aim for a Ph.D in mathematics.  My interests are in pure mathematics; mathematics for its own sake.</p>
        <p>I see a bright future for myself.</p>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <div><b>09-16-2019</b></div>
        <p>As a kid, family is very important to development.  My family has had a huge role in shaping who I am.  From the good to the bad, everything has had a role in shaping who I am.  It is those who are closest to you that can betray you the hardest. Your person is shaped by those around and nearest to you.  These are things that can often be out of your control.</p>
        <p>I believe that everyone can be divided into 3 parts: the mind; the body; and the person.  The mind is the intellect and wisdom you have acquired in your life.  Either by yourself or others, and by mistakes and triumphs.  The body is your physical self.  This is something that is part of you but doesn't represent you.  The person is your personality; what you do without knowledge.  This is who you truly are.  One should be liked for their person and not their body.</p>
        <p>My mind is extensive, but specific.  I have a lot of holes in my knowledge but a lot of knowledge overall.  This is due to me having been in special education schools most of my life.  I had to self-educate myself to get my information.  This is a good example of how those around us can shape us, beyond our control.</p>
        <p>My body is quite skinny.  I am still a kid, yes.  But genetics play a big part in this.  Research suggests that for some people, genes account for just 25% of the predisposition to be overweight, while for others the genetic influence is as high as 70% to 80%.<sup><a href="#family">[1]</a></sup>  I can't shape my body as much as I want to.  I want to be heavier, and not underweight.  I try to eat more, and it kind of works, but I still can see my ribcage in the mirror.</p>
        <p>My person is oblivious, but empathetic.  I don't notice a lot of things, but still notice enough to be empathetic.  If I am not empathetic, then at least sympathetic.  The difference between empathy and sympathy is that empathy is when you have been in that situation before, whereas sympathy is when you haven't, but still feel bad anyways.  Empathy is often stronger than sympathy.  I am also autistic and have A.D.H.D., so I can either hyperfocus or not remember a single thing.  I am extremely social but socially awkward, so I don't always say things that I should.</p>
        <p>All of these things that add up to make me, but these things can change.  As I said, my family has a big role in changing who I am.  Some people in my family makes me feel better than others.  I actually feel like they are a part of the family and not just in it.  My parents and grandparents are closer to me than some of my aunts or cousins.  They make me laugh and feel happy.</p>
        <p>Close friends also play a role in my life.  They aren't as powerful as family, but they affect me nonetheless.  As an only child, they are as close to having siblings as I will probably ever get.  They give me memories of friendship as vivid as family.  Close friends are the border between like and love.  Sometimes I really want siblings, but they also give me practice as to what it is like to actually have siblings, of any kind.</p>
        <p>These people close to me help get me out of difficult situations, like trauma.  They also put me into difficult situations, like trauma.  We love family, but may not like them.  Like is wanting to be with them, whereas love is being there for them.</p>
        <p>As much as they shape me, I shape them too.  I gave my parents a new life.  I gave memories to my relatives.  I am a new face at the table.  I add so much to the lives of those I care about, even if we have our troubles.  That's what love is for, to bind us together even if experiences should have torn us apart.</p>
        <p>My family is very important to me.  They shape me, I shape them.  They give me the love I need.  I provide for them.  They provide for me.</p>
        <p>Despite everything that we have been through, love binds us together.</p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <div><b>09-25-2019</b></div>
        <p>Everyone has goals for themselves.  We strive to be something different, something greater, something better.  Often, these goals aren't met.  For example, a lot of people have New Year's resolutions.  19.7% of all New Year's resolutions in the United States are to "exercise and lose weight."<sup><a href="#goals">[2]</a></sup>  More often than not, they fail.  Starting isn't an issue, it is maintaining it for an extended period of time.</p>
        <p>I have goals for myself.  I would like to be a pure mathematician.  Pure mathematics is mathematics for its own sake.  This is an area that both interests me and I am good at.  I want to get a PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Math has always been my passion.  I was in special ed. schools my entire elementary.  The classwork taught there was always too easy for me, and I didn't learn anything.  I had to self-educate at home, resulting in me having many holes in my knowledge.  I focused on math the most, and that is where I developed my passion for it.</p>
        <p>I decided that I wanted to be a pure mathematician, and I have stuck with that goal from then on.  I decided that I wanted to go to UC Berkeley and to get a PhD in mathematics.  The fact that I have stuck to this goal for so long suggests that this may be the career goal I will end up with.</p>
        <h3>Culture</h3>
		<div><b>10/10/2019</b></div>
        <p>Everyone has a culture.  Whether it is your religion or nationality, you have a culture.  Culture isn't something that is fixed.  If you choose to identify as a specific culture, that becomes your culture.  A culture is many people sharing a common belief or tradition.  One person is not a culture.  My culture is american culture, with loud sounds and industry all about.</p>
        <p>American culture is strange, it is many cultures blended together with no set value.  There are loud cars, loud people, loud places.  There are the terrible smells of sewer and the pleasant smells of barbeque.  America is industrialized, meaning we have had an industrial revolution.  We cut down our trees, we burned our fossil fuels.  We have caused a lot of damage.  Now we all want to fix this, or at least, most of us.</p>
        <p>I am of portugese descent, but the only thing that we do from portugese culture is eating a very good meat called, linguisa.  I think I am not a part of any obvious culture, but I am a part of something.</p>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
		<div><b>10/10/2019</b></div>
        <p>Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.  Everyone has something that they are bad at, and something that they excel at.  I am good at computer programming and mathematics, and that is my career goal.  I want to be a pure mathematician when I grow up.  I also have a website.  Math has been my favorite subject for a while, and I don’t think that is going to change.</p>
        <p>I like mathematics because it just feels natural to me.  The equations that seem mind-boggling to most make perfect and intuitive sense to me.  I have always excelled at math, and I am going to try my best to achieve my goals.  I learned most of my mathematical knowledge, not at school, but at home.  For most of my life, I was in special ed. schools.  There, most of the kids were behind academically, but not me.  I was ahead of all of them, and in order to learn what I wanted (keep in mind, not what I needed), I had to self-educate, resulting in holes in my knowledge.</p>
        <p>These holes made some later math a touch difficult, but I still had to be put in special classes due to my excellence.  This shows how even the smartest of us still struggle.</p>
