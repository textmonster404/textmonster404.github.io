        <p indent="true" align="j">Today I attempted to learn more of the classroom dynamics.  I have been having a small amount of trouble figuring out everyone's names, but I figure that in enough time I will have everyone's names figured out.  Names have always been an issue for me, but I can learn them with time.</p>
        <p indent="true" align="j">Every morning I have to ride my bike to the school.  I have to leave at about 7:45 AM, as the school starts at 8:00 AM.  When I get to the office, I sign in and get a vistor badge.  I head to room 15, Leslie Foreé's room.  All of the kids call her Ms. Foreé, so I do too to avoid confusion.  I act as a T.A. (teacher's assistant).  I basically do anything that Ms. Foreé asks me to do.</p>

        <p indent="true" align="j">Today is Halloween.  This year I have decided that I do not want to go trick-or-treating.  This was because I didn't have a costume picked out, but mostly because I just didn't want to.  My parents wanted me to go to my internship with a costume on, "because the kids will love it."  I argued that it would be a pain to ride my bike with a giant doughnut costume.</p>
        <p indent="true" align="j">When I arrived, all of the kids and all but a few of the adults had costumes.  There were many games and activities for the kids, including by not limited to, tic-tac-toe, cookie making, and coloring.  I quickly programmed a touch-screen game of PONG on my chromebook and hosted that as an activity.  I made a cookie to take back to school.</p>
        <p indent="true" align="j">The cookie made the trek back to my school a bit awkward, but in the end, I managed to deliver the most important cargo, the cookie, successfully.  Programming that game gave me a bit of experience with reading touches to the screen, and I also learned one more of the students' names; Bear.</p>
